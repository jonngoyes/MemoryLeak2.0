Overview: 
MemoryLeak2.0 is a game designed to help aspiring C++ developers learn the ropes of the language. The game is played like a BubbleShooter game where the player maneuvers a rocket and fires bullets are correct answer choices that are floating down. It comes with different levels that focus on C++ topics like polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, and excapsulation. MemoryLeak2.0 is a fun, interactive game targeted at students who want to ace their upcoming technical interview, junior level developers looking to refresh their memory of C++, and beginners who want an easy way to quickly learn the language.
