Overview: 
MemoryLeak2.0 is a game designed to help aspiring C++ developers learn the ropes of the language. The game is played like a BubbleShooter game where the player maneuvers a rocket and fires bullets are correct answer choices that are floating down. It comes with different levels that focus on C++ topics like polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, and excapsulation. MemoryLeak2.0 is a fun, interactive game targeted at students who want to ace their upcoming technical interview, junior level developers looking to refresh their memory of C++, and beginners who want an easy way to quickly learn the language. Made with Android Studio environment. Back-end funcationality implemented with Java and JSON. Front-end formatted with XML. 


Building the Project:
To build the project, click the build icon in the toolbar if running on Android Studio. Choose a device you want to run the project on. The app runs best on an Android Pixel 3 XL with Android Version 10.0. This is because the phone screen is big enough for the positions we assigned the objects. The app seems to work on all Android versions 4.0 and higher. If you are planning to download the app to an Android phone, make sure that the screen size is comparable to a Pixel 3 XL and to have the necessary driver files on your computer. Also, enable USB debugging in developer options. Have fun playing the game!!!

Disclaimer:
Some elements of the game, especially during the normal gameplay, is not stable. We have ran into problem such as crashing and incorrect registering of bullet hitting the target. Unfortunately, we are not able to fix it due to the limited time left before the project's deadline. We are very sorry for your inconvinence.
